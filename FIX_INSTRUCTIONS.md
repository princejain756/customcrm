# Fix Instructions for ScanBill to Tally Application

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ React Router Navigation Issue
**Problem**: `Warning: Cannot update a component (BrowserRouter) while rendering a different component (Login)`

**Solution**: Fixed in `src/pages/Login.tsx`
- Moved navigation logic to `useEffect` hook
- Added proper dependency array `[user, navigate]`
- Prevents setState during render

### 2. ✅ Database Relationship Error
**Problem**: `Could not find a relationship between 'leads' and 'profiles' in the schema cache`

**Solution**: Fixed in `src/pages/Index.tsx`
- Removed the problematic join with `user:profiles(*)`
- The `leads` table has `user_id` that references `auth.users(id)`, not `profiles`
- Simplified the query to only include necessary relationships

### 3. ✅ Storage Bucket Error
**Problem**: `StorageApiError: Bucket not found`

**Solution**: Created `supabase/migrations/20250101000004_fix_storage_buckets.sql`
- Properly configured storage bucket with correct parameters
- Added file size limits and allowed MIME types
- Created proper storage policies

### 4. ✅ Authentication Error Handling
**Problem**: `AuthApiError: Invalid Refresh Token: Refresh Token Not Found`

**Solution**: Enhanced `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Added graceful handling of refresh token errors
- Automatically clears session on token refresh failures
- Improved error handling in auth state changes

## Steps to Apply Fixes

### Step 1: Run Database Migrations
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Run the contents of `run_migrations.sql` to fix storage buckets and database relationships

### Step 2: Restart Your Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
bun dev
```

### Step 3: Clear Browser Storage (Optional)
If you're still experiencing authentication issues:
1. Open browser developer tools
2. Go to Application/Storage tab
3. Clear localStorage and sessionStorage
4. Refresh the page

## Verification Steps

### 1. Test Authentication
- Try logging in with valid credentials
- Check that no React Router warnings appear
- Verify that refresh token errors are handled gracefully

### 2. Test Database Queries
- Navigate to the dashboard
- Check browser console for any database relationship errors
- Verify that leads and orders are loading correctly

### 3. Test File Upload
- Try uploading a file through the bill scanner
- Verify that storage bucket errors are resolved

## Code Changes Summary

### Files Modified:
1. `src/pages/Login.tsx` - Fixed navigation issue
2. `src/pages/Index.tsx` - Fixed database query
3. `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Improved error handling
4. `supabase/migrations/20250101000004_fix_storage_buckets.sql` - New migration
